# **Introduction to machine learning using Galaxy software**

## **Context**
This repository contains my completed work for the machine learning introduction tutorial using Galaxy.


## **Objectives**
- Learn how to use Galaxy for data preparation and ML modeling.
- Train a classifier (using an SVM model) to distinguish sample types.
- Create a galaxy workflow
- Obtain a prediction result (0: no breast cancer, 1: positive breast cancer) after training the model.

## **Dataset**
